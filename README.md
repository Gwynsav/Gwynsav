# About me
I'm a Computer Science student living abroad (hopefully permanently) and just trying to get by.

This is my personal account where I post abhorrent creations that should never be anywhere near my real
name, like Linux rices using _"soon to be deprecated"_ (average Waylander copium) X software like AwesomeWM.

I hope reading my code is enough to traumatize you and permanently prevent you from using anything here,
which I strongly advise against doing.

## So what do you actually know?
I generally dabble in Lua, Java, ARM ASM, and C programming, but I wouldn't call myself an expert in any
of those.

## WAHHHHHHHHH YOUR PROJECT BROKE MY SYSTEM
I put warnings not to use anything I make in basically every one of my repos, reading is a nice skill to have.
